Certainly! Let's break down the multiplication step-by-step:

**Problem:**  
Calculate \(15 \times 24\).

---

### Step 1: Break Down the Numbers
We can simplify the calculation by breaking down one of the numbers into smaller, more manageable parts. 

Let's split 24 into two parts:
\[
24 = 20 + 4
\]

**Step 2: Multiply Each Part**
Now, multiply each part by 15.

1. **Multiply \(20 \times 15\):**
   \[
   20 \times 15 = 300
   \]
   
2. **Multiply \(4 \times 15\):**
   \[
   4 \times 15 = 60
   \]

---

### Step 3: Add the Results
Finally, add the two products together:
\[
300 + 60 = 360
\]

**Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
