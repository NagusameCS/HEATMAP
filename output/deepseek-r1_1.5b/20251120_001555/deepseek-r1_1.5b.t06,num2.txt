**Solution:**

To calculate \( 15 \times 24 \), follow these steps:

1. **Break down the multiplication:**
   - Break down 15 into 10 and 5.
   - Keep 24 as it is.

2. **Multiply each part separately:**
   
   - Multiply 10 by 24:
     \[
     10 \times 24 = 240
     \]
     
   - Multiply 5 by 24:
     \[
     5 \times 24 = 120
     \]

3. **Add the products together:**
   \[
   240 + 120 = 360
   \]

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
