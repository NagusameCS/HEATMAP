To find the square root of **144**, we need to determine a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals **144**.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Check for obvious factors:**
   - We know that \(12 \times 12 = 144\).  
   
2. **Verify the multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(12 \times 10 = 120\) and \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
   - Add the results together: \(120 + 24 = 144\).

Since \(12 \times 12 = 144\), we can conclude that:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
