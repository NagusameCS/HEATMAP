To calculate \(15 \times 24\), follow these easy steps:

1. **Break Down the Numbers:**
   - \(15 = 10 + 5\)
   - \(24\) is already a two-digit number.

2. **Multiply Each Part Separately:**
   
   - Multiply by \(10\):
     \[
     10 \times 24 = 240
     \]
     
   - Multiply by \(5\):
     \[
     5 \times 24 = 120
     \]

3. **Add the Results Together:**
   \[
   240 + 120 = 360
   \]

**Final Answer:**

\(\boxed{360}\)
